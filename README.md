**ðŸ’¡ This is a work in progress**
---
This is a simple node based editor for building branching narratives, made graciously with [Flume](https://flume.dev/). This was partly made as an experiment (because I like node editors) and partly because I like branching narratives and simplicity. Story graphs can be exported as JSON to be used elsewhere as your project sees fit. 

# Getting Started 
To run the project, i.e., boot up the editor, clone the repository, install the packages with `npm install` and then run the project with `npm start`.
